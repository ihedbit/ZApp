Welcome to **Zellular-ZApps**, a collection of decentralized applications (dApps) built using [Zellular](https://docs.zellular.xyz), a decentralized sequencer designed to provide high-throughput, fault-tolerant consensus and messaging.


## Projects

This repository includes two s examples demonstrating the implementation  using Zellular:

1. **Fungible Token Standard**
   - Implementation of an ERC-20 token with decentralized sequencing.

2. **Decentralized Downtime Monitoring System**
   - A monitoring system to track and report downtime events in a decentralized manner.


## Getting Started

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ihedbit/ZApp.git
   cd Zellular-DApps
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Each project includes specific setup instructions within its respective folder.

3. **Run the example**:
   Follow the provided instructions to deploy the smart contracts on a local blockchain environment (such as Ganache) or a testnet.
